/*:
This second chapter is focused on proving equiprobability. A good way of proving it, is rolling a dice. 
 
The event of rolling a dice is equiprobable, that means that each face of the dice has the same probability of appearing.
 
To desmostrate this we are going to create a Random Normalized Distribution which shows perfectly how a dice works.
 

**1.** Enter the number of times you want to roll the dice. As we need a big sample, the minimum number needs to be 1000
